CryptoPortfolioBuilder

Welcome to CryptoPortfolioBuilder, a beginner-friendly Python tool to create a diversified crypto portfolio with weighted allocations based on trending cryptocurrencies with strong long-term potential. This tool:





Fetches real-time prices using CoinGecko's free API.



Allocates your investment (e.g., $500) across 5 trending coins, with weights favoring higher-promise assets (e.g., 30% Bitcoin, 25% Ethereum).



Projects hypothetical 1-year returns based on averaged analyst predictions.



Balances risk by capping any single coin at ~30% of the portfolio.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is for educational purposes only. Crypto is highly volatile‚Äîprices can swing 20-50% in days. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) and only invest what you can afford to lose!

Features





Dynamic Allocations: Weights coins based on long-term potential (e.g., Bitcoin for stability, Ethereum for DeFi).



Real-Time Data: Pulls live prices from CoinGecko for accurate calculations.



Future Projections: Estimates portfolio value in 1 year using analyst predictions (hypothetical!).



Beginner-Friendly: Simple command-line interface with tips for new investors.

Prerequisites





Python 3.6+: Ensure Python is installed (download here).



Requests Library: Install via pip install requests.

Installation





Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CryptoPortfolioBuilder.git
cd CryptoPortfolioBuilder



Install the required library:

pip install requests



Ensure an active internet connection (for API calls).

Usage





Run the script:

python weighted_portfolio_builder.py



Enter your investment amount (e.g., $500) when prompted.



View your portfolio breakdown, including:





Allocations and weights (e.g., 30% BTC, 25% ETH).



Current prices and shares bought.



Projected 2026 value and growth % (hypothetical).



Example output for $500:

| Crypto      | Weight | Alloc | Curr Price | Shares  | Pred Price | Future Val |
|-------------|--------|-------|------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Bitcoin (BTC) | 30%  | $150  | $123039.00 | 0.001219 | $150,000 | $182.85    |
| Ethereum (ETH)| 25%  | $125  | $4533.37   | 0.02757  | $8,000   | $220.56    |
...
**Total Current Value: $500.00**
**Est. Value in 1 Year (2026): $924.86**
**Projected Growth: +84.97%**

How It Works





Coin Selection: Picks 5 trending coins (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, XRP) based on real-time web analyses for 2026 potential.



Weighting: Allocates more to higher-promise coins (e.g., 30% BTC, 10% XRP) but caps at ~30% to diversify risk.



Live Prices: Fetches current USD prices via CoinGecko API.



Projections: Uses averaged analyst predictions for 2026 prices (e.g., BTC to $150,000). These are speculative and not guarantees.

Current Coin Picks (Oct 2025)

Based on aggregated expert analyses:





Bitcoin (BTC): 30% ‚Äì Institutional "digital gold."



Ethereum (ETH): 25% ‚Äì DeFi and scaling leader.



Solana (SOL): 20% ‚Äì High-speed blockchain for apps.



Cardano (ADA): 15% ‚Äì Research-driven, sustainable.



XRP (Ripple): 10% ‚Äì Cross-border payment utility.

Future-Proofing





Dynamic Updates: Coin picks and weights can be updated yearly based on new trends (e.g., if BTC fades, it‚Äôs swapped for a rising star like BNB or Avalanche).



Run Anytime: Live API ensures prices are always current when you execute the script.

Tips for Beginners





Start Small: Test with a mock portfolio (like this tool) before investing real money.



Track: Use apps like CoinMarketCap or Delta to monitor real investments.



Diversify: This tool spreads risk, but always research each coin‚Äôs tech and team.



Stay Safe: Use reputable exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and secure wallets (e.g., Ledger).
